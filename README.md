This is a basic To-do app made using React JS. Here, in this project I used the concept of Context API with Local Storage.

Initially our list is empty:

I want to add some tasks I would like to do today, I guess just need to write it down and click 'Add' button,  
Yes! Here are some of the added tasks:

I want to specify that I have to practice DSA problems on Leetcode, is there an option to edit??  
The tasks are editable!!, just click on the 'pencil' icon and voila! one can edit a task, click 'folder' icon to save it again

Put a tick mark on the tasks done, it's a neat strikethrough

Oh! I have to attend a meeting, I can't watch Haikyu, I must delete it but how??  
To delete an unwanted task from the To-Do list, simply click the 'X' button, it's just that simple!

I don't want these tasks to disappear when I referesh the page or return to the page after some time, is this possible??  
Yes!! The concept used to make this To-Do List project is Context API with Local Storage, which sets it apart from various other To-Do apps made using only HTML,CSS & JS.
